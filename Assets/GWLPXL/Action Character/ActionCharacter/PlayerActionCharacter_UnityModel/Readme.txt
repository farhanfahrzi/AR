This addon displays Action Character in use with Unity's starter asset model with animations. It uses Unity's legacy input system by default.

The Player two instance ("_P2") requires their input to be configured in the input manager. It's an example of how you can extend the action character to accomodate multiple local players.
Once P2's input is configured, enable the gameobject to try it out.

Open the demo scene to try it out.
